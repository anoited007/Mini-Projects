**PROBLEM**

A group of n students have been arranged into a circle at positions 0 to n − 1. Proceeding around the circle,
every m th student will be selected to present their implementation of a Doubly Linked List to class except
the last student to be selected. When a student is selected, they move from the circle to a queue of students
waiting to present their code.
Write a program that takes as input n and m and outputs the position in the circle you should stand in, so
that you do not have to present your code.

Input: An integer n and an integer m.
Output: An integer representing the position in the circle of the last student to be selected.
Example — Input: n = 4, m = 2 — Output: 0
