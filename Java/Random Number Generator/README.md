This class contains methods for manipulating the java.util.Random class in Java. It has been used to generate random trip that
suggests to a user where to go for the next vacation and the number of days to stay there.

It has also been used to mimic how numbers in a lottery can be generated. The class also contains a method to generate secure
password for users to use. This method is just a demonstration of what the class could be used for but there are better ways
to generate secure passwords for users to use.
